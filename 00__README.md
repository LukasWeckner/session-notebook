## Session-Notebook

This repository serves as a collection of all handouts and topics covered during the 12-week web development bootcamp I participated from April 2023 to July 2023. Here, you can find everything I learned during the program.

Feel free to explore the materials and code samples to gain insights into the various taught web dev concepts and practices.

In order to get more familiar with git I only used the command-line interface to save and structure all files.
