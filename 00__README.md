## Session-Notebook

This repository serves as a collection of all handouts and topics covered during the 12-week web development bootcamp I participated from April 2023 to July 2023. Here, you can find everything I learned during the program.

Feel free to explore the materials and code samples to gain insights into the various taught web dev concepts and practices.

For every single topic there were between 1-6 challenges to apply the new knowledge. Those challenges can't be found here to prevent abuse of the excercices created by the course provider.
